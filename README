Known Bugs
There is a bug during multi-player that a player will jump way too high randomly. If this happens, they will come back down within 10 seconds.
Jump heights are also variable in multiplayer, so getting to the end platform (yellow one) may be challenging, but is possible.
In order to account for the variable jump height, I set the gravity to be much lower so that it is always possible to get to the end.
